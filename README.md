# Privacy-preserving Triangle Counting in Directed Graphs
## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for **Privacy-preserving Triangle Counting in Directed Graphs**. 
We study two scenarios for triangle counting in directed graphs under edge differential privacy (edge-DP). One for trusted central servers under edge centralized differential privacy (edge-CDP), the other for untrusted central server under edge local differential privacy (edge-LDP).
# Datasets
We use 6 real-world directed graphs to evaluate our proposed algorithms. All datasets can be downloaded from SNAP
